Hello Lions and welcome back to university for the winter term!


The Astronomy Club wishes a great and successful year for you all and good luck with your academic terms.


We are back with hosting more events for Winter 2023 and cannot wait to see you all once more! 

If you have any questions or comments, you can email us at yorkastronomy@gmail.com.


Stay  tuned for more updates and news about events but for tomorrow (Jan 18th), there  will be a club fair hosted by YFS annually starting from 10 AM to 4 PM  located at the Second Student Centre in the basement on the first floor.  Come and say hi, play games to win free merch and ask as many ACYU  questions as you want!
